// Redux has this IDEA ðŸ’¡ that you cant change this STATE directly,
//  you wanna replace the object as opposed to directly modifying the state

// - Toolkit has this Built-In Library (one thing he might not agree with)
//  where you can act like you modified the state directly â‡’ 
//  though under the hood, this is not what is happening
// - state.mode reps the  previous condition
//     - AND WHAT YOU set it to will be the new STATE  when you call this function

// these are simple function that modify our state as we need -> setSumSh*t
